Fetches Open Pull-Requests for an Organisation from Github

# Installation

Simply:

```ruby
gem install openpull
```

and add a Github access token to your environment in `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
An access token can be generated by going to your "Settings", then "Applications" and then "Generate new token"

Then run it with:

```bash
openpull -u omegahm -o lokalebasen
```

or set `GITHUB_USERNAME` and `GITHUB_ORGANISATION` to make it easier to run.

# What's going on?

It'll print some coloured dots - a green for each repository in the organisation and a yellow for each open pull-request - and then print a table of all the open pull-requests with their current statuses.
